**# Project 10: WTWR**

**# Description**
The WTWR is web application for checking the weather and temperature in your area. Additionaly it also provies recommendations on what clothing you should wear based on their given conditions.

**# Tech Stack**

- HTML
  In my project, I used html to construct the layout of the website. Even though you don't see that much in index.html, we had used html within the JavaScript XML extension files. This allows to manipulate the html with the JavaScript in a more efficient way. Instead of having to switch between both JavaScript and HTML files, they have been combined into one.

- CSS
  The CSS was used in its regular css files to furnish, organize, and make the the flexible for all users to use. Using my knowledge of padding, margins, flexbox, text styles and others I wwas able to bring my website to life.

- Weather API
  This was the most important part of the project, because it allowed us to tell the weather. By connecting the Weather API interface with our project, it can tell you the temperature, day, location, and climate of where you are.

- Javascript
  Out of all of our programming languages and outside interfaces used, JavaScript was practised the most. We had many jsx files ultlized within our components that did the behind the scene functions for each section.
